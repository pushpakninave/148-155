# this is rishu learning linux

1 cat example.txt
2 ls
3 mkdir documnets
4 cp file1.txt /backup
5 cd ..
  -> to navigate to parent directory
  -> cp ../B1/fruits.txt fruits.txt == copy one dir to amother 
  -> can access any folder from any folder - just need correct path
6 grep "apple" fruits.txt
7 rm -rf old_files
8 du -k report.pdf
  -> or ls -s fruits.txt
  -> or ls -ltr == show all data and file permissions
9 mv oldname.txt newname.txt
10 tail -n 10 logfile.txt
   -> or tail -10 example.txt
11 useradd john
   -> sudo adduser == also ask password
12 passwd john
   -> enter password 2 times
13 userdel -r alice
   -> use sudo 
14 chmod 644 data.txt
   -> 6-user read write 4-group read 4-others read
15 chown bob:staff shared
   -> create bob and staff then using useradd else try with existing in system
   -> list all users in your system == cat /etc/passwd

-> directly run program without needing to change permission == bash filename.sh
-> # single line comment
-> <<arg multi line comments - - - arg  == create argument after << and close by same argument
-> sum=$((op1+op2)) == use for any calculation
-> let sum=$n1+$n2 == not much used but will work
-> sum2=$((n1+n2)) == most used
-> echo $((n * $(fact $((n-1))))) == using funtion inside equation 

==> Loops
-> for((i=1;i<=5;i++)) do -- done
-> for i in 1 2 3 4 5 do -- done
-> for j in Rishu Kumar do echo "$j" done
-> for k in {1..5} do -- done == needs continous
-> for i in "rk" pk gk do -- done
-> for(( ;; )) do echo "Hi" sleep 2s done  == infinite loop


==> Pipe
-> take the input from another command
-> ls | grep "while.sh"
-> for i in $(cat $text) do --- done


==> arguments
-> script name - $0
-> Total no. of args - $#
-> all args - $@
-> 1st arg - $1
-> 2nd arg - $2 ...
